This program searches through text files to locate keywords. The keywords in this case are Avengers (character name, or alias). This program then
creates Avenger objects for each character, adds them to an hashmap of Avenger objects, and tracks the amount of times they are mentioned. Avengers are then added to
multiple different arraylists and sorted based on the desired comparison algorithms. 

This was a university assignment that was submitted as a .jar file for easy output comparison. There is a placeholder in the java files that allows for manual .txt file selection.
This assignment was meant to demonstrate the use of comparable and comparator while using arraylists.
